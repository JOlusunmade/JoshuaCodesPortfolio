Front End Developer Portfolio consisting of projects built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Welcome to my front-end developer portfolio! This repository showcases a collection of projects I have built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Each project focuses on different aspects of front-end development, including responsive design, interactivity, and user experience.

The main technologies used in these projects include:

HTML
CSS
JavaScript
Feel free to explore the code and project files to see how these technologies were implemented.
